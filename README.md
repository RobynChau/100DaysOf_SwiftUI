# 100DaysOf_SwiftUI
This repository was created for the purpose of noting the process of learning SwiftUI from Course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) and sharing my personal experience of learning and building applications using SwiftUI and Playgrounds 4 on the M1 iPad Pro.

The repository includes two main folders namely Playgrounds and XCode. Each folder contains the source code created using Playgrounds 4 on the Ipad or XCode on the Mac.

Furthermore, while the course has a long list of amazing projects to learn from, I believe some technical projects do not need to be shared as the main point of them is to follow instructions. Therefore, I only upload the big projects that are packed with many skills
